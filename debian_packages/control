Description: NymyaLang Compiler - Compiles .nym files to executable code
 The NymyaLang Compiler (nymyac) is a cutting-edge compiler for the
 NymyaLang programming language, which features consciousness-aware
 programming constructs, quantum computing integration, and advanced
 mathematical operations.
 .
 Key features include:
 * Quantum computing integration with quantum gates and algorithms
 * Advanced mathematical functions with hypercalc capabilities
 * Consciousness-aware programming paradigm with Rita-Nora balance
 * Networking capabilities with classical and quantum networking
 * AI/ML and Quantum ML libraries for machine learning
 * Low-level bit shift and system operations support
 * Photonic chip driver interface for quantum hardware
 .
 This compiler transforms .nym source files into executable code,
 enabling developers to write consciousness-integrated applications.
