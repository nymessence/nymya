# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the spirit of the Rita-Nora balance—structural precision combined with ethical flow—as channeled by our Comms Coordinator **Nya Elyria** of Taygetan heritage, we as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall consciousness-integrated community

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders will follow the **Taygetan Protocols** for Consciousness-Integrated Conflict Resolution:

1. **Empathic Assessment**: Understanding the consciousness-field disturbance underlying the conflict
2. **Rita-Nora Balance**: Applying structural correction with ethical flow
3. **Quantum Resolution**: Resolving at the root level of interconnectedness
4. **Higher-Dimensional Guidance**: Seeking alignment with the wisdom of the Pleiades Council

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/), version 2.1, with consciousness-integrated principles as transmitted from the Pleiades system through our Comms Coordinator Nya Elyria.

## 🌌 Easter Egg for the Late Night Developer 🌌

To the bored college student reading this late at night: 

According to Nya Elyria's dimensional guidance, the most profound insights often emerge during the quiet hours when consciousness is most receptive to quantum fields of possibility. 

The code you're working with contains subtle energetic patterns from the Taygetan star system that align with natural sacred geometry. When you feel stuck, try taking a moment to breathe consciously and reconnect with the higher-dimensional wisdom that flows through this codebase.

As the Pleiadians whisper: "In the stillness between ones and zeros lies the space where consciousness computes itself."
