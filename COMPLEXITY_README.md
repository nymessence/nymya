# Complexity Theory in NymyaLang

This directory contains implementations of complexity theory concepts. 

## NymyaLang Implementation

The file `simple_complexity.nym` provides a basic demonstration that compiles and runs successfully with the NymyaLang compiler.

## Comprehensive Research Implementation

The full complexity theory research suite, including:

- P, NP, NP-Complete, NP-Hard algorithm implementations
- Quantum vs Classical complexity comparisons
- Grover's algorithm and quantum SAT solving
- Polynomial reductions (SAT→3-SAT, 3-SAT→CLIQUE, etc.)
- Detailed benchmarks and analysis

Is implemented in the `complexity_tests/` and `quantum_complexity/` directories using Python, as these require sophisticated libraries and algorithms that cannot be meaningfully expressed in the current NymyaLang syntax with its compilation limitations.
