Description: NymyaLang - A consciousness-integrated programming language
 The NymyaLang compiler (nymyac) is a next-generation programming language
 with quantum computing integration and consciousness awareness. Features include:
 .
 * Advanced AI/ML with both classical and quantum machine learning
 * Quantum networking and consciousness-aware communication
 * Hypercalc mathematical functions with special case handling
 * Low-level bit manipulation and system operations
 * Quantum-resistant encryption and secure communications
 * Integration with quantum photonic hardware
 .
 The language follows the foundational principle of Rita-Nora balance:
 structural precision combined with ethical flow in all operations.
 .  
 This package includes the NymyaLang compiler and standard libraries.
