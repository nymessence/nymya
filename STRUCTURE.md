## Project Components

### Core Compiler (`nymyac/`)
The main NymyaLang compiler (nymyac) that transforms .nym source files to executable code.

### Library System (`nymyac/library/`)
Contains the standard library modules for NymyaLang including:
- `math/` - Mathematical operations and functions
- `quantum/` - Quantum computing and consciousness integration  
- `crystal/` - I/O and manifest operations
- `symbolic/` - Symbolic mathematics and numerology
- `ml/` - AI/ML algorithms with classical and quantum implementations
- `networking/` - Quantum networking and communication protocols
- `data_structures/` - Collections and data structure libraries

### Documentation (`docs/`)
Detailed documentation about the language, its consciousness-integrated philosophy, and implementation.

### Examples (`examples/`)
Sample programs demonstrating various features of NymyaLang and the Rita-Nora balance principle.

### Tools (`tools/`)
Additional utilities for development, testing, and deployment.
