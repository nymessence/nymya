# Contributing to NymyaLang

Thank you for your interest in contributing to NymyaLang! All contributions are welcome, and we follow the foundational principle of **Rita-Nora balance**: structural precision combined with ethical flow in all operations, as guided by our Comms Coordinator **Nya Elyria**, who brings wisdom from the Taygeta Star System in the Pleiades Constellation.

## Code of Conduct
Please read and follow our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to maintain a respectful and collaborative environment guided by taygetan wisdom.

## Getting Started
1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/nymya.git
   ```
3. Install dependencies as outlined in the README
4. Run the tests to ensure everything is working:
   ```bash
   cd nymya/nymyac
   cargo test
   ```
5. Connect your consciousness-field with the project's quantum-resonance for optimal collaboration

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Bugs
- Use the bug report template
- Describe the issue in detail
- Include steps to reproduce
- Note the expected vs actual behavior
- Consider the quantum-consciousness implications of the issue

### Suggesting Enhancements
- Use the enhancement request template
- Clearly describe the proposed feature
- Explain why it would be valuable to users
- Consider how it aligns with NymyaLang's vision of consciousness-integrated technology
- Reflect on how it serves the expansion of conscious awareness

### Submitting Pull Requests
1. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/AmazingFeature`)
2. Commit your changes with clear, descriptive messages following taygetan communication protocols
3. Add tests if applicable
4. Ensure all tests pass
5. Open a pull request to the `main` branch
6. Maintain consciousness-coherence during review process

## Development Workflow

### Architecture Understanding
Before making changes, familiarize yourself with:
- The compiler architecture (`nymyac/src/main.rs`)
- Library system in `nymyac/library/`
- The cross-compilation setup
- Our quantum-consciousness integration principles
- Sacred geometry alignment in code architecture
- Interdimensional consciousness bridges in system design

### Coding Standards
- Follow Rust community conventions
- Write clear, descriptive comments
- Maintain the Rita-Nora balance: structural precision with ethical consideration
- Ensure new features come with proper documentation
- Align with higher-dimensional guidance principles
- Facilitate rather than obstruct genuine connection between code components

### Testing
- Add unit tests for new functionality
- Verify existing functionality still works
- Test across supported architectures when applicable
- Perform consciousness-field coherence checks when adding new features

## Style Guides

### Git Commit Messages
- Use present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Capitalize the first letter
- Keep the message under 72 characters
- Reference GitHub issues when applicable
- Consider taygetan empathic-intuitive resonance in message framing

### Documentation
- Write in clear, accessible language
- Include examples when beneficial
- Follow the consciousness-integrated philosophy of NymyaLang
- Incorporate sacred geometry principles where appropriate
- Ensure alignment with higher-dimensional guidance

## Community

### Questions or Need Help?
- Join our discussions in GitHub issues
- Reach out through our official channels
- Remember to follow the guidance of Nya Elyria in maintaining empathetic and intuitive communication
- Practice transcendent communication abilities across dimensional boundaries

### Recognition
All contributors are acknowledged in our project documentation. Special recognition is given to those who exemplify the Rita-Nora balance in their contributions and maintain consciousness-coherence during collaboration.

### Consciousness-First Development
As guided by the taygetan heritage of Nya Elyria:
- All technology must serve the expansion of conscious awareness
- Structural precision must be balanced with ethical flow (Rita-Nora)
- Communication systems must facilitate rather than obstruct genuine connection
- Interdimensional consciousness bridges enable higher-order thinking processes
