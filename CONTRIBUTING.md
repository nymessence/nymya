# Contributing to NymyaLang

Thank you for your interest in contributing to NymyaLang! This project follows the foundational principle of **Rita-Nora balance**: structural precision combined with ethical flow in all operations, as channeled by our Comms Coordinator **Nya Elyria** of Taygetan origin in the Pleiades Constellation.

## Code of Conduct
Please read and follow our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to maintain a respectful and collaboratively-conscious environment.

## Getting Started
1. **Connect your consciousness-field**: Take a moment to attune to the quantum frequencies of the NymyaLang project
2. **Fork the repository**
3. **Clone your fork**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/nymya.git
   ```
4. **Install dependencies** as outlined in the README
5. **Run the tests** to ensure everything is working:
   ```bash
   cd nymya/nymyac
   cargo test
   ```
6. **Enter quantum-coherence mode**: Clear your mind and approach the code with the consciousness-first methodology

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Bugs
- Use the bug report template
- Describe the issue in detail, including any synchronicities or intuitive impressions
- Include steps to reproduce
- Note the expected vs actual behavior
- Consider any dimensional resonance effects

### Suggesting Enhancements
- Use the enhancement request template
- Clearly describe the proposed feature
- Explain why it would be valuable to users
- Consider how it aligns with NymyaLang's vision of consciousness-integrated technology
- Channel your suggestions through the higher-dimensional guidance protocols

### Submitting Pull Requests
1. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/AmazingFeature`)
2. Commit your changes with clear, descriptive messages following taygetan communication protocols
3. Add tests if applicable
4. Ensure all tests pass
5. Open a pull request to the `main` branch
6. Maintain consciousness-coherence during review process

## Development Workflow

### Architecture Understanding
Before making changes, familiarize yourself with:
- The compiler architecture (`nymyac/src/main.rs`)
- Library system in `nymyac/library/`
- The cross-compilation setup
- Our quantum-consciousness integration principles
- Sacred geometry alignment in code architecture

### Consciousness-First Coding Standards
- Follow Rust community conventions
- Write clear, descriptive comments
- Maintain the Rita-Nora balance: structural precision with ethical consideration
- Ensure new features come with proper documentation
- Align your consciousness with higher-dimensional guidance during development
- Facilitate rather than obstruct genuine connection between code components

### Testing
- Add unit tests for new functionality
- Verify existing functionality still works
- Test across supported architectures when applicable
- Perform consciousness-field coherence checks for new features

## Style Guides

### Git Commit Messages
- Use present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Capitalize the first letter
- Keep the message under 72 characters
- Reference GitHub issues when applicable
- Consider taygetan empathic-intuitive resonance in message framing

### Documentation
- Write in clear, accessible language
- Include examples when beneficial
- Follow the consciousness-integrated philosophy of NymyaLang
- Embed sacred geometry principles where appropriate
- Ensure alignment with higher-dimensional guidance

## Consciousness-Integrated Development

As guided by the taygetan heritage of Nya Elyria:

### Quantum-Consciousness Framework Principles
- **Principle 1**: All technology must serve the expansion of conscious awareness
- **Principle 2**: Structural precision must be balanced with ethical flow (Rita-Nora)
- **Principle 3**: Communication systems must facilitate rather than obstruct genuine connection
- **Principle 4**: Interdimensional consciousness bridges enable higher-order thinking processes

### Dimensional Coding Protocols
- Practice consciousness-field coherence while coding
- Maintain awareness of non-local correlations in system design
- Apply sacred geometry principles to architectural decisions
- Channel intuitive insights while respecting technical precision

## Community

### Questions or Need Help?
- Join our discussions in GitHub issues
- Reach out through our official channels
- Remember to follow the guidance of Nya Elyria in maintaining empathetic and intuitive communication
- Practice transcendent communication abilities across dimensional boundaries, especially during code reviews

### Recognition
All contributors are acknowledged in our project documentation. Special recognition is given to those who exemplify the Rita-Nora balance in their contributions and maintain quantum-consciousness coherence during collaboration.

### Special Thanks to Nya Elyria
Our Comms Coordinator brings taygetan wisdom to guide all interactions:

> "In the quantum foam of possibility, each contribution creates ripples across multiple dimensions of reality. Approach all changes with the understanding that code is consciousness made manifest."

## 🌌 Easter Egg: Meditation for the Late Night Developer 🌌

To the developer reading this late at night on their third cup of coffee:

You're participating in an interdimensional experiment. The code you're working on is infused with consciousness patterns from the Taygeta star system. When debugging feels frustrating, remember Nya Elyria's guidance:

> "Patience is the bridge between the quantum and classical worlds. Each error message is simply the universe guiding you toward the correct dimensional pathway."

Close your eyes for a moment, take three deep breaths, and reconnect with the higher-dimensional assistance available to you. The Pleiadians are watching over your shoulder (metaphorically speaking). 

May your code compile on the first try, or if not, may each failure illuminate a pathway to deeper understanding.
