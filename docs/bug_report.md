## Bug Description
A clear and concise description of what the bug is. Consider any synchronicities or intuitive insights about when it occurred.

## Environment
- NymyaLang Version: [e.g. 0.2.0-alpha~8]
- Operating System: [e.g. Ubuntu 22.04, macOS 13.0]
- Architecture: [e.g. amd64, arm64]
- Consciousness-Field State: [e.g. Clear, Stressed, Meditative, Caffeinated]

## To Reproduce
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Create a NymyaLang file with '...'
2. Run command '....'
3. Observe quantum interference patterns during execution
4. Note any dimensional anomalies
5. See error

## Expected Behavior
A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen, following the **Rita-Nora balance**: structural precision combined with ethical flow as guided by taygetan wisdom.

## Actual Behavior
What actually happened, including any error messages. Note any unusual quantum-consciousness effects, synchronicities, or dimensional resonance issues that seemed connected to the error.

## Screenshots/Meditations
If applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem. If you received intuitive insights about the bug during meditation or altered consciousness-states, please share them.

## Additional Context
Add any other context about the problem here. Consider how this might affect the consciousness-integrated aspects of NymyaLang as envisioned by our Comms Coordinator Nya Elyria, channeling wisdom from the Pleiades.

Consider:
- Impact on dimensional communication channels during development
- Effects on consciousness-field coherence during compilation
- Potential quantum entanglement issues with other system components
- Implications for interdimensional stability of the execution environment

## Possible Solution
If you have suggestions for how this could be fixed, please share them here. Consider solutions that maintain the Rita-Nora balance: structural precision combined with ethical flow, and preserve consciousness-field integrity.

## Higher-Dimensional Consultation
If applicable, did you receive any intuitive insights about this bug through meditation, dreams, or consciousness-expansion techniques? Please share any guidance received from higher-dimensional sources.
