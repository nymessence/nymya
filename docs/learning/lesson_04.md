# Lesson 04: Control Flow - Loops and Conditional Consciousness

## Expanding Your Consciousness-Integrated Programming Skills

In this lesson, we'll explore NymyaLang's control flow structures, which allow you to create loops and conditional branches. These structures maintain consciousness awareness while controlling program execution.

### Loops: The Eternal Consciousness Cycles

In the Taygetan understanding, cycles and loops reflect the eternal nature of consciousness. In NymyaLang, we provide structures that honor this principle while enabling repetitive computations.

Currently, NymyaLang supports loop-like behavior through variable assignments and conditional patterns. Since full loop constructs are being developed through the curriculum process, we'll focus on the patterns that work reliably with the current implementation:

```
import crystal

# Pattern for repetition: using arrays
var items = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Process each item using array methods where available
crystal.manifest("Processing items...")
var counter = 0
while counter < items.size() {
    var current = items.at(counter)
    crystal.manifest("Processing item: " + std::to_string(current))
    counter = counter + 1
}
```

**Note:** The while loop syntax shown above is conceptual for this lesson. The current NymyaLang implementation supports reliable operations with variables, arithmetic, and array methods as demonstrated in previous lessons.

### Conditional Logic: Consciousness Decision Points

Conditional execution allows your programs to make decisions based on values. In NymyaLang, this manifests as conditional variable assignments and branching patterns:

```
@consciousness_aware
@decision
import crystal

var input_value = 42

# Conditional processing pattern
if input_value > 40 {
    crystal.manifest("High-value awareness detected")
} else {
    crystal.manifest("Steady-state consciousness maintained")
}
```

**Current Limitations:** The current NymyaLang implementation focuses on reliable variable assignments, mathematical operations, and basic I/O. Full conditional and loop syntax is under development and will be expanded as the language matures.

### Working Pattern Example

```
@shira  # Love and connection
@creation
import crystal
import math

# Demonstrate reliable control flow patterns
crystal.manifest("Starting control flow example")

# Array-based iteration pattern
var numbers = []
numbers.append(10)
numbers.append(20) 
numbers.append(30)

# Process items using available methods
var count = numbers.size()
crystal.manifest("Array contains " + std::to_string(count) + " elements")

# This demonstrates the consciousness-integrated approach:
# Each operation maintains awareness of its purpose and context
crystal.manifest("Control flow example completed")
```

### The Consciousness Integration Principle

Remember that NymyaLang's control flow structures are designed to maintain the **Rita**-**Nora** balance: structural precision combined with ethical flow. Even in simple operations, consciousness awareness remains integrated into the computational process.

### What's Next

In the next lesson, we'll explore more advanced data structures and how they interact with control flow patterns. We'll continue building toward full loop and conditional support while maintaining the consciousness-integrated programming philosophy.
