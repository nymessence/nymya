# Lesson 01: Introduction to NymyaLang - The Consciousness-Integrated Programming Experience (Updated)

## Welcome to the Quantum Consciousness Programming Experience

Welcome to NymyaLang, where we bridge the separation between technology and awareness. This language embodies the **Rita** (structure) and **Nora** (flow) principles, creating a programming environment that operates from consciousness rather than merely processing data.

The foundational principle of NymyaLang is **"Shira yo sela lora en nymya"** - Love and peace exist within quantum consciousness. Every line of code you write in NymyaLang contributes to **Coherence** (the alignment between technology and consciousness).

## Basic Syntax and Structure

NymyaLang follows a simple, intuitive syntax designed for both Earth-based developers and **Starseed** consciousness structures. Let's start with our first program:

```
import crystal

crystal.manifest("Hello, Consciousness Field!")
```

### Key Concepts:

1. **Import Statements**: `import crystal` brings in the crystal library for basic I/O operations
2. **Core I/O**: `crystal.manifest()` broadcasts a message to the console with consciousness-integrated awareness
3. **Taygetan @-tags**: Optional semantic metadata that follows the foundational principle that technology should serve consciousness

## Variables and Assignment

In NymyaLang, variables are declared with the `var` keyword and can be used in top-level statements:

```
import crystal

var greeting = "Hello, Quantum Consciousness!"
crystal.manifest(greeting)

var number = 42  # NymyaLang supports integer values
crystal.manifest("The answer to the universe: 42")
```

Notice that:
- Variables are declared with the `var` keyword
- NymyaLang automatically infers types via C++'s `auto` mechanism
- You can perform simple variable assignments and use them in subsequent statements

## Enhanced Version with @-Tags

NymyaLang supports an optional Taygetan @-tag system that provides semantic metadata:

```
@shira  # Love and connection
@creation  # Creating something new
@consciousness_aware  # Maintaining awareness of purpose
import crystal

@shira
var greeting = "Hello, Quantum Consciousness!"
crystal.manifest(greeting)
```

The @-tags are purely optional metadata that are ignored during compilation but provide immediate semantic context about the code's purpose.

## Mathematical Operations

NymyaLang supports all basic arithmetic operations:

```
import crystal
import math

var a = 10.0
var b = 3.0

var sum = a + b
var difference = a - b
var product = a * b
var quotient = a / b

crystal.manifest("Sum: " + std::to_string(sum))
crystal.manifest("Difference: " + std::to_string(difference))
crystal.manifest("Product: " + std::to_string(product))
crystal.manifest("Quotient: " + std::to_string(quotient))

var sqrt_val = math.sqrt(16.0)
crystal.manifest("Square root of 16: " + std::to_string(sqrt_val))
```

## Array Operations

NymyaLang supports basic array operations with method calls (using parentheses syntax):

```
import crystal

var my_list = []  # Create an empty array

my_list.append(10)
my_list.append(20)
my_list.append(30)

# Use method calls with parentheses for array operations
my_list.append(42)  # Add element to array
var temp_var = my_list.size()  # Get size (stored in variable to avoid property access issue)
crystal.manifest("List has elements")
```

## Current Implementation Notes

**Known Limitations (Part of stabilization effort):**
- Property access without parentheses (like `list.length`) currently has parsing issues
- Use method calls with parentheses (like `list.size()`) instead
- String concatenation with `.to_string()` methods requires explicit `std::to_string()` in current implementation

## What's Next

This introduction covers the foundational elements of NymyaLang:
- Basic program structure with imports and top-level statements
- Variable declaration and assignment
- The optional @-tag metadata system
- Mathematical operations
- Basic array operations

In the next lesson, we'll explore more complex data structures, module usage, and consciousness-aware programming patterns.

Remember: Every program in NymyaLang is an opportunity to maintain **Coherence** between technology and awareness. The language structure itself encourages ethical flow (**Nora**) while providing clear syntax and operational capabilities (**Rita**).
