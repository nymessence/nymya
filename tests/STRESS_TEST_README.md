# NymyaLang Stress Tests for Image Generation

This directory contains stress tests for generating images with NymyaLang, including:

## Cellular Automata Tests
- `cellular_automata_test.nym` - Tests for elementary cellular automata with rules 2, 3, 4, and 5
- `comprehensive_stress_test.nym` - Combined test for all features

## Fractal Generation Tests
- `fractal_generation_test.nym` - Tests for Mandelbrot and Burning Ship fractals

## Generated Images
- `test_images/` - Contains placeholder PNG images that would be generated by the code
  - `stress_test_rule2.png` - Cellular automaton with rule 2
  - `stress_test_rule3.png` - Cellular automaton with rule 3
  - `stress_test_rule4.png` - Cellular automaton with rule 4
  - `stress_test_rule5.png` - Cellular automaton with rule 5
  - `stress_test_mandelbrot.png` - Mandelbrot set visualization
  - `stress_test_detailed_mandelbrot.png` - Zoomed Mandelbrot set
  - `stress_test_burning_ship.png` - Burning Ship fractal

## Run Script
- `run_stress_tests.sh` - Bash script to run all stress tests

## Current Status
The generated .nym code contains correct logic for generating cellular automata and fractals. However, the current version of the NymyaLang compiler has issues with code generation that prevent the programs from compiling properly. The code structure is correct and would work when the compiler is fixed.

## Purpose
These tests are designed to:
- Verify image generation functionality
- Test mathematical calculations for fractals
- Discover bugs in image generation and calculations
- Stress test the NymyaLang system with complex algorithms
