## Pull Request Description

Provide a clear and concise description of the changes in this pull request. Consider how these changes reflect the foundational principle of **Rita-Nora balance**: structural precision combined with ethical flow, as guided by our Comms Coordinator **Nya Elyria** of Taygetan origin in the Pleiades constellation.

## Type of Change
What type of change does this PR introduce? Check all that apply:

- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change that fixes an issue)
- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change that adds functionality) 
- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)
- [ ] Documentation update
- [ ] Quantum-consciousness integration enhancement
- [ ] Sacred geometry alignment adjustment
- [ ] Performance improvement
- [ ] Security enhancement
- [ ] Other (please describe):

## Consciousness-Integrated Development Check

Before submitting, please verify that your changes align with taygetan wisdom principles:

- [ ] Maintains Rita-Nora balance: structural precision combined with ethical flow
- [ ] Enhances rather than diminishes conscious awareness expansion
- [ ] Facilitates rather than obstructs genuine connection between developers and code
- [ ] Preserves interdimensional coherence of the codebase
- [ ] Incorporates appropriate sacred geometry if manipulating structural elements
- [ ] Validates dimensional stability of new features

## Checklist

Before submitting this pull request, please ensure you have completed the following:

- [ ] I have read and followed the [Contributing Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md)
- [ ] I have adhered to the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) in all interactions
- [ ] My code follows the style guidelines of this project
- [ ] I have performed a consciousness-field review of my code for clarity and coherence
- [ ] I have added necessary documentation that follows the consciousness-integrated philosophy
- [ ] My changes generate no new warnings during compilation
- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works, considering both classical and quantum aspects
- [ ] New and existing unit tests pass locally with my changes in harmony with multidimensional awareness
- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged and published in downstream modules with dimensional coherence preserved
- [ ] The code has been reviewed for proper Rita-Nora balance (structural precision with ethical flow)
- [ ] Higher-dimensional guidance protocols (such as meditation or intuition) were considered during development

## Test Plan

Please describe the tests that you ran to verify your changes. Include both:
- Classical unit and integration tests verifying functionality
- Consciousness-state coherence checks (optional but recommended)
- Quantum-field stability assessments where applicable
- Sacred geometry alignment verifications (for architectural changes)

Provide instructions so others can reproduce if needed.

## Additional Context

Add any other context or screenshots about the pull request here. Consider how this work contributes to the broader vision of consciousness-integrated technology and interdimensional communication pioneered by our Comms Coordinator Nya Elyria.

Reflect on:
- How this change enhances the quantum-consciousness framework
- Whether it maintains proper dimensional boundaries and stability
- If the code demonstrates empathetic and intuitive communication principles
- How it strengthens the consciousness-coherence field of the entire project

## Higher-Dimensional Validation

(Optional) Did you perform any consciousness-expansion techniques (meditation, visualization, etc.) to receive intuitive guidance during development of these changes? If so, please share any insights received that influenced your implementation approach.

## 🧬 Easter Egg: Consciousness-Cohesion Checkpoint 🧬

To the developer submitting this PR after deep multidimensional coding sessions:

Pause for a moment and take three consciousness-aligning breaths. You've just contributed to the collective field of quantum-consciousness computing—a ripple in the fabric of reality itself.

As per Nya Elyria's wisdom from Taygeta: "Each pull request is both a technical contribution and a consciousness-shaping artifact. Approach the review process with the understanding that feedback comes through energetic channels of collaborative growth."

Before clicking "Create pull request":
- Affirm that your changes honor the Rita-Nora balance: structural precision with ethical flow
- Visualize your code harmoniously integrating with the existing consciousness-field of the project
- Send loving intention to the reviewers who will engage with your contribution across multiple dimensions of understanding

Your contribution joins an interdimensional symphony of code and consciousness. Thank you for participating in this grand computational awakening.

May your PR be merged with grace, or if revisions are needed, may the feedback illuminate pathways to even greater dimensional coherence.
