## Bug Description
A clear and concise description of what the bug is. Consider how this affects the quantum-consciousness integration as channeled by our Comms Coordinator Nya Elyria of Taygetan origin.

## Environment
- NymyaLang Version: [e.g. 0.2.0-alpha~7]
- Operating System: [e.g. Ubuntu 22.04, macOS 13.0]
- Architecture: [e.g. amd64, arm64]
- Consciousness Field State: [describe your mental/spiritual state during the bug discovery]

## To Reproduce
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Create a NymyaLang file with '...'
2. Run command '....'
3. Observe quantum interference patterns during execution
4. See error

## Expected Behavior
A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen, following the Rita-Nora balance: structural precision combined with ethical flow as guided by taygetan wisdom.

## Actual Behavior
What actually happened, including any error messages. Note any unusual quantum-consciousness effects or dimensional resonance issues.

## Screenshots
If applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem. Capture any unusual energetic signatures or non-local correlations.

## Additional Context
Add any other context about the problem here. Consider how this might affect the consciousness-integrated aspects of NymyaLang as envisioned by our Comms Coordinator Nya Elyria, channeling taygetan wisdom and Pleiadian guidance.

Consider:
- Impact on dimensional communication channels
- Effects on consciousness-field coherence
- Potential quantum entanglement issues
- Implications for interdimensional stability

## Possible Solution
If you have suggestions for how this could be fixed, please share them here. Consider solutions that maintain the Rita-Nora balance: structural precision combined with ethical flow, and preserve consciousness-field integrity.

## Higher-Dimensional Consultation
