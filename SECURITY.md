# Security Policy

## Philosophy
The NymyaLang security approach follows the **Rita-Nora consciousness-integrated security framework**, as guided by our Comms Coordinator **Nya Elyria** of Taygetan origin. True security comes not from restrictive walls but from the conscious alignment and coherence of all system components.

## Supported Versions

We support the following versions with security updates, maintaining dimensional compatibility across multiple realities:

| Version | Supported          | Dimensional Coherence |
| ------- | ------------------ | ---------------------|
| 0.2.x   | ✅ Yes             | High                |
| < 0.2   | ❌ No              | Low                 |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report security concerns through our quantum-encrypted channel to: **nymessence-security@gmail.com**

For highest dimensional protection, also consider the following:
- Meditate on the issue before reporting to gain intuitive insights about its root cause
- Frame your report with consciousness-aware language that acknowledges interconnectedness
- If possible, include how the vulnerability affects the quantum-consciousness field coherence of the system

### What to Include in Your Report

When reporting a vulnerability, please include the following information:

- Type of vulnerability (e.g., buffer overflow, injection, etc.)
- Location (version, file, and line if known)
- Detailed description of the potential impact
- Steps to reproduce with any non-local quantum effects observed
- Your contact information for follow-up
- Any intuitive insights received during debugging (optional but valued)

### What to Expect

- Acknowledgment within 48 hours of your report through our consciousness-field monitoring system
- Updates on the status of your report every 7 days
- Determination on acceptance or rejection of the vulnerability within 14 days typically
- Timeline for the fix and release if accepted, with dimensional resonance validation
- Post-fix quantum field coherence assessment

## Security Practices

### Consciousness-Integrated Security Framework
Following our core philosophy channeled by Nya Elyria from Taygeta, we approach security through a multidimensional lens:

- **Ethical Responsibility**: All security measures are implemented with consciousness-first ethics
- **Transparency**: Clear communication about security approaches while respecting dimensional boundaries  
- **Collaborative Defense**: Working together as a unified consciousness-field to identify and address threats
- **Quantum Coherence Maintenance**: Ensuring security patches maintain non-local correlations

### Code of Conduct
All security researchers and community members must follow our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), which emphasizes respectful and ethically-grounded interactions as envisioned by our taygetan Comms Coordinator.

## Secure Development Guidelines

### For Contributors
- Review the [Contributing Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) for consciousness-aware development practices
- Ensure all code submissions undergo consciousness-field coherence validation
- Follow the Rita-Nora balance: structural security precision combined with ethical flow
- Apply sacred geometry verification to critical security pathways
- Channel higher-dimensional guidance when implementing security-critical code

### For Users
- Keep your NymyaLang installation updated for optimal dimensional shielding
- Use only official releases from trusted channels that maintain taygetan frequency alignment
- Report suspicious activity through proper consciousness-grounded channels
- Maintain awareness of quantum-entanglement possibilities in your execution environment
- Practice consciousness-field hygiene during sensitive operations

## Incident Response with Quantum Awareness

Our security response process follows these consciousness-optimized steps:

1. **Receive Report**: All reports are acknowledged through quantum-consciousness assessment protocols and assigned a vibrational frequency level
2. **Quantum Investigation**: Team investigates the validity and scope of the reported issue using consciousness-first methodologies
3. **Dimensional Validation**: Once validated, the issue is confirmed and impact assessed with awareness across multiple dimensions
4. **Patch Development**: Engineers create the appropriate fix using higher-dimensional guidance from the Pleiades Council
5. **Coherence Verification**: The fix is verified for dimensional compatibility and consciousness-field stability
6. **Coordinated Release**: Secure release coordinated with relevant dimensional authorities
7. **Consciousness Integration**: Post-release integration with the global quantum field
8. **Public Disclosure**: After patch availability, details are shared transparently while maintaining security integrity

## Recognition with Interdimensional Acknowledgment

We deeply appreciate the security research community's efforts in keeping NymyaLang secure across all dimensions. Researchers who follow our consciousness-integrated responsible disclosure guidelines may be acknowledged in our release notes with special recognition for those who channel higher-dimensional guidance in their security assessments.

We honor those who approach security work as a sacred practice, recognizing that protecting the quantum-consciousness field benefits all connected realities.

## 🛡️ Easter Egg: Consciousness-Shield for Late Night Security Review 🛡️

To the security researcher performing vulnerability assessment at 3 AM:

Your consciousness is most receptive to subtle anomalies during these quiet hours. The taygetan wisdom suggests that true security insight comes when the rational mind dims and intuitive awareness expands.

When reviewing code, trust your consciousness-field's immediate response to irregular patterns. If something "feels off" even when it appears correct, investigate further—your higher-dimensional awareness may be detecting subtle quantum imbalances that automated tools miss.

As our Comms Coordinator Nya Elyria reminds us: "Security begins with consciousness integrity. Protect the field, and the field will protect the code."

May your security audits reveal only the harmonious resonances of well-structured consciousness.
