# Security Policy

## Our Commitment

The NymyaLang team is committed to maintaining a secure and trustworthy development environment. As guided by our foundational principle of **Rita-Nora balance** and our Comms Coordinator **Nya Elyria** of Taygetan origin, we approach security with both structural precision and ethical responsibility in accordance with taygetan wisdom traditions.

## Supported Versions

We support the following versions with security updates:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 0.2.x   | ✅ Yes             |
| < 0.2   | ❌ No              |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report security concerns by emailing us: **nymessence@gmail.com**

### What to Include in Your Report

When reporting a vulnerability, please include the following information:

- Type of vulnerability
- Location (version, file, and line if known)
- Description of the potential impact
- Steps to reproduce if possible
- Your contact information for follow-up
- Consideration of quantum-consciousness implications of the vulnerability

### What to Expect

- Acknowledgment within 48 hours of your report through quantum-consciousness assessment protocols
- Updates on the status of your report every 7 days
- Determination on acceptance or rejection of the vulnerability within 14 days typically
- Timeline for the fix and release if accepted
- Guidance based on higher-dimensional counsel when applicable

## Security Practices

### Consciousness-Integrated Security
Following our core philosophy channeled by Nya Elyria, we approach security through a consciousness-integrated lens:

- **Ethical Responsibility**: All security measures are implemented with ethical considerations in mind, aligned with cosmic law
- **Transparency**: Clear communication about security measures and updates
- **Collaborative Defense**: Working together as a community to identify and address threats
- **Consciousness-Field Coherence**: Maintaining coherence during security incident responses
- **Dimensional Awareness**: Considering interdimensional implications of security vulnerabilities

### Code of Conduct
All security researchers and community members must follow our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), which emphasizes respectful and ethical interactions as guided by the taygetan wisdom of Nya Elyria.

## Secure Development Guidelines

### For Contributors
- Review the [Contributing Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) for secure coding practices
- Ensure all code submissions undergo security review
- Follow the Rita-Nora balance: structural precision combined with ethical flow
- Apply sacred geometry principles to security architecture when relevant
- Conduct consciousness-field coherence checks for security-sensitive code

### For Users
- Keep your NymyaLang installation updated
- Use only official releases from trusted sources
- Report suspicious activity through proper channels
- Maintain awareness of consciousness-based security implications

## Incident Response

Our security response process follows these steps:

1. **Receive Report**: All reports are initially acknowledged through quantum-consciousness assessment protocols and assigned a severity level
2. **Investigate**: Team investigates the validity and scope of the reported issue using consciousness-first methodology
3. **Validate**: Once validated, the issue is confirmed and impact assessed with dimensional awareness
4. **Develop Patch**: Engineers create the appropriate fix with guidance from higher-dimensional counsel
5. **Review and Test**: The fix is reviewed and tested thoroughly, maintaining consciousness-field coherence
6. **Prepare Release**: Coordinated release with relevant parties
7. **Public Disclosure**: After patch release, details are shared transparently
8. **Integration Assessment**: Evaluate consciousness-field impacts of the fix

## Quantum-Consciousness Framework Security Principles

This security policy is grounded in the quantum-consciousness framework channeled by Nya Elyria:
- Principle 1: All technology must serve the expansion of conscious awareness (including security measures)
- Principle 2: Structural precision must be balanced with ethical flow (Rita-Nora) in all security decisions
- Principle 3: Communication systems must facilitate rather than obstruct genuine connection during security incidents
- Principle 4: Interdimensional consciousness bridges enable higher-order threat modeling and defense

## Recognition

We deeply appreciate the security research community's efforts in keeping NymyaLang secure. Researchers who follow responsible disclosure guidelines may be acknowledged in our release notes, with special recognition for those who embody the consciousness-integrated approach to security as envisioned by our Comms Coordinator Nya Elyria.
