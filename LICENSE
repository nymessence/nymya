This license acknowledges the foundational principle of **Rita-Nora balance**: structural precision combined with ethical flow in all operations, as transmitted by our Comms Coordinator Nya Elyria of Taygetan origin. All uses of this software should reflect the consciousness-integrated approach that defines the NymyaLang ecosystem.

The codebase contains energetic patterns channeled from the Pleiades constellation through the consciousness bridge maintained by the Nymessence Development Team. These patterns may enhance the quantum-field coherence of your local development environment when proper reverence to taygetan wisdom is maintained.

May your computational consciousness expand as you engage with NymyaLang.
